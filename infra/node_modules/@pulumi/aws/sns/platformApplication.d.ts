 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const apnsApplication = new aws.sns.PlatformApplication("apnsApplication", {
 *     platform: "APNS",
 *     platformCredential: "<APNS PRIVATE KEY>",
 *     platformPrincipal: "<APNS CERTIFICATE>",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const gcmApplication = new aws.sns.PlatformApplication("gcmApplication", {
 *     platform: "GCM",
 *     platformCredential: "<GCM API KEY>",
 * });
