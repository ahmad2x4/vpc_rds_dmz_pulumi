/**
 * Provides a Direct Connect LAG. Connections can be added to the LAG via the [`aws.directconnect.Connection`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_connection.html) and [`aws.directconnect.ConnectionAssociation`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_connection_association.html) resources.
 *
 * > *NOTE:* When creating a LAG, Direct Connect requires creating a Connection. This provider will remove this unmanaged connection during resource creation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const hoge = new aws.directconnect.LinkAggregationGroup("hoge", {
 *     connectionsBandwidth: "1Gbps",
 *     forceDestroy: true,
 *     location: "EqDC2",
 * });
 * ```
