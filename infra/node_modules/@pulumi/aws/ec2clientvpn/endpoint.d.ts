 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.ec2clientvpn.Endpoint("example", {
 *     authenticationOptions: {
 *         rootCertificateChainArn: aws_acm_certificate_root_cert.arn,
 *         type: "certificate-authentication",
 *     },
 *     clientCidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16",
 *     connectionLogOptions: {
 *         cloudwatchLogGroup: aws_cloudwatch_log_group_lg.name,
 *         cloudwatchLogStream: aws_cloudwatch_log_stream_ls.name,
 *         enabled: true,
