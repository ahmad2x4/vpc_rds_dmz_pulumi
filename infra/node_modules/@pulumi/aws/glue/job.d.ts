/**
 * Provides a Glue Job resource.
 *
 * > Glue functionality, such as monitoring and logging of jobs, is typically managed with the `defaultArguments` argument. See the [Special Parameters Used by AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html) topic in the Glue developer guide for additional information.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Python Job
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.glue.Job("example", {
 *     command: {
 *         scriptLocation: pulumi.interpolate`s3://${aws_s3_bucket_example.bucket}/example.py`,
 *     },
 *     roleArn: aws_iam_role_example.arn,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Scala Job
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.glue.Job("example", {
 *     command: {
 *         scriptLocation: pulumi.interpolate`s3://${aws_s3_bucket_example.bucket}/example.scala`,
 *     },
 *     defaultArguments: {
 *         "--job-language": "scala",
 *     },
 *     roleArn: aws_iam_role_example.arn,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Enabling CloudWatch Logs and Metrics
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleLogGroup = new aws.cloudwatch.LogGroup("example", {
 *     retentionInDays: 14,
 * });
 * const exampleJob = new aws.glue.Job("example", {
 *     defaultArguments: {
 *         // ... potentially other arguments ...
 *         "--continuous-log-logGroup": exampleLogGroup.name,
 *         "--enable-continuous-cloudwatch-log": "true",
 *         "--enable-continuous-log-filter": "true",
 *         "--enable-metrics": "",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
