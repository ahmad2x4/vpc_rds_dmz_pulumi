import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides a Lambda event source mapping. This allows Lambda functions to get events from Kinesis, DynamoDB and SQS.
 *
 * For information about Lambda and how to use it, see [What is AWS Lambda?][1].
 * For information about event source mappings, see [CreateEventSourceMapping][2] in the API docs.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### DynamoDB
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.lambda.EventSourceMapping("example", {
 *     eventSourceArn: aws_dynamodb_table_example.streamArn,
 *     functionName: aws_lambda_function_example.arn,
 *     startingPosition: "LATEST",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Kinesis
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.lambda.EventSourceMapping("example", {
 *     eventSourceArn: aws_kinesis_stream_example.arn,
 *     functionName: aws_lambda_function_example.arn,
 *     startingPosition: "LATEST",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### SQS
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.lambda.EventSourceMapping("example", {
 *     eventSourceArn: aws_sqs_queue_sqs_queue_test.arn,
 *     functionName: aws_lambda_function_example.arn,
 * });
 * ```
