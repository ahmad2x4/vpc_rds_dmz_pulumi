import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Attaches an EC2 instance to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). For attaching resources with Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB), see the [`aws.lb.TargetGroupAttachment` resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lb_target_group_attachment.html).
 *
 * > **NOTE on ELB Instances and ELB Attachments:** This provider currently provides
 * both a standalone ELB Attachment resource (describing an instance attached to
 * an ELB), and an Elastic Load Balancer resource with
 * `instances` defined in-line. At this time you cannot use an ELB with in-line
 * instances in conjunction with an ELB Attachment resource. Doing so will cause a
 * conflict and will overwrite attachments.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * // Create a new load balancer attachment
 * const baz = new aws.elb.Attachment("baz", {
 *     elb: aws_elb_bar.id,
 *     instance: aws_instance_foo.id,
 * });
 * ```
