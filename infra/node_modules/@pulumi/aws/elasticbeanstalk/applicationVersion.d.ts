/**
 * Provides an Elastic Beanstalk Application Version Resource. Elastic Beanstalk allows
 * you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about
 * the infrastructure that runs those applications.
 *
 * This resource creates a Beanstalk Application Version that can be deployed to a Beanstalk
 * Environment.
 *
 * > **NOTE on Application Version Resource:**  When using the Application Version resource with multiple
 * Elastic Beanstalk Environments it is possible that an error may be returned
 * when attempting to delete an Application Version while it is still in use by a different environment.
 * To work around this you can either create each environment in a separate AWS account or create your `aws.elasticbeanstalk.ApplicationVersion` resources with a unique names in your Elastic Beanstalk Application. For example &lt;revision&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const defaultBucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("default", {});
 * const defaultBucketObject = new aws.s3.BucketObject("default", {
 *     bucket: defaultBucket.id,
 *     key: "beanstalk/go-v1.zip",
 *     source: new pulumi.asset.FileAsset("go-v1.zip"),
 * });
 * const defaultApplication = new aws.elasticbeanstalk.Application("default", {
 *     description: "tf-test-desc",
 * });
 * const defaultApplicationVersion = new aws.elasticbeanstalk.ApplicationVersion("default", {
 *     application: "tf-test-name",
 *     bucket: defaultBucket.id,
 *     description: "application version",
 *     key: defaultBucketObject.id,
 * });
 * ```
