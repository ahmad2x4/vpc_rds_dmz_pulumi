/**
 * Provides an Elastic Beanstalk Environment Resource. Elastic Beanstalk allows
 * you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about
 * the infrastructure that runs those applications.
 *
 * Environments are often things such as `development`, `integration`, or
 * `production`.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const tftest = new aws.elasticbeanstalk.Application("tftest", {
 *     description: "tf-test-desc",
 * });
 * const tfenvtest = new aws.elasticbeanstalk.Environment("tfenvtest", {
 *     application: tftest.name,
 *     solutionStackName: "64bit Amazon Linux 2015.03 v2.0.3 running Go 1.4",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Option Settings
 *
 * Some options can be stack-specific, check [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options-general.html)
 * for supported options and examples.
 *
 * The `setting` and `allSettings` mappings support the following format:
 *
 * * `namespace` - unique namespace identifying the option's associated AWS resource
 * * `name` - name of the configuration option
 * * `value` - value for the configuration option
 * * `resource` - (Optional) resource name for [scheduled action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options-general.html#command-options-general-autoscalingscheduledaction)
 *
 * ### Example With Options
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const tftest = new aws.elasticbeanstalk.Application("tftest", {
 *     description: "tf-test-desc",
 * });
 * const tfenvtest = new aws.elasticbeanstalk.Environment("tfenvtest", {
 *     application: tftest.name,
 *     settings: [
 *         {
 *             name: "VPCId",
 *             namespace: "aws:ec2:vpc",
 *             value: "vpc-xxxxxxxx",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             name: "Subnets",
 *             namespace: "aws:ec2:vpc",
 *             value: "subnet-xxxxxxxx",
 *         },
 *     ],
 *     solutionStackName: "64bit Amazon Linux 2015.03 v2.0.3 running Go 1.4",
 * });
 * ```
