/**
 * Provides an AutoScaling Scaling Policy resource.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** You may want to omit `desiredCapacity` attribute from attached `aws.autoscaling.Group`
 * when using autoscaling policies. It's good practice to pick either
 * [manual](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/as-manual-scaling.html)
 * or [dynamic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/as-scale-based-on-demand.html)
 * (policy-based) scaling.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const bar = new aws.autoscaling.Group("bar", {
 *     availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
 *     forceDelete: true,
 *     healthCheckGracePeriod: 300,
 *     healthCheckType: "ELB",
 *     launchConfiguration: aws_launch_configuration_foo.name,
 *     maxSize: 5,
 *     minSize: 2,
 * });
 * const bat = new aws.autoscaling.Policy("bat", {
 *     adjustmentType: "ChangeInCapacity",
 *     autoscalingGroupName: bar.name,
 *     cooldown: 300,
 *     scalingAdjustment: 4,
 * });
 * ```
