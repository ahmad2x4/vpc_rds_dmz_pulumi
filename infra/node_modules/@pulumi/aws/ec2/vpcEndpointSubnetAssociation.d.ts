import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides a resource to create an association between a VPC endpoint and a subnet.
 *
 * > **NOTE on VPC Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Subnet Associations:** This provider provides
 * both a standalone VPC Endpoint Subnet Association (an association between a VPC endpoint
 * and a single `subnetId`) and a VPC Endpoint resource with a `subnetIds`
 * attribute. Do not use the same subnet ID in both a VPC Endpoint resource and a VPC Endpoint Subnet
 * Association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const snEc2 = new aws.ec2.VpcEndpointSubnetAssociation("snEc2", {
 *     subnetId: aws_subnet_sn.id,
 *     vpcEndpointId: aws_vpc_endpoint_ec2.id,
 * });
 * ```
