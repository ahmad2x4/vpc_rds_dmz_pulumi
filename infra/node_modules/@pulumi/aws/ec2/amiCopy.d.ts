/**
 * The "AMI copy" resource allows duplication of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI),
 * including cross-region copies.
 *
 * If the source AMI has associated EBS snapshots, those will also be duplicated
 * along with the AMI.
 *
 * This is useful for taking a single AMI provisioned in one region and making
 * it available in another for a multi-region deployment.
 *
 * Copying an AMI can take several minutes. The creation of this resource will
 * block until the new AMI is available for use on new instances.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.ec2.AmiCopy("example", {
 *     description: "A copy of ami-xxxxxxxx",
 *     sourceAmiId: "ami-xxxxxxxx",
 *     sourceAmiRegion: "us-west-1",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "HelloWorld",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
