/**
 * Provides an AWS EIP Association as a top level resource, to associate and
 * disassociate Elastic IPs from AWS Instances and Network Interfaces.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Do not use this resource to associate an EIP to `aws.lb.LoadBalancer` or `aws.ec2.NatGateway` resources. Instead use the `allocationId` available in those resources to allow AWS to manage the association, otherwise you will see `AuthFailure` errors.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** `aws.ec2.EipAssociation` is useful in scenarios where EIPs are either
 * pre-existing or distributed to customers or users and therefore cannot be changed.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const web = new aws.ec2.Instance("web", {
 *     ami: "ami-21f78e11",
 *     availabilityZone: "us-west-2a",
 *     instanceType: "t1.micro",
 *     tags: {
 *         Name: "HelloWorld",
 *     },
 * });
 * const example = new aws.ec2.Eip("example", {
 *     vpc: true,
 * });
 * const eipAssoc = new aws.ec2.EipAssociation("eipAssoc", {
 *     allocationId: example.id,
 *     instanceId: web.id,
 * });
 * ```
