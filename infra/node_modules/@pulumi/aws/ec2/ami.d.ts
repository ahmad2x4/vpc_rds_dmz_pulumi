/**
 * The AMI resource allows the creation and management of a completely-custom
 * *Amazon Machine Image* (AMI).
 *
 * If you just want to duplicate an existing AMI, possibly copying it to another
 * region, it's better to use `aws.ec2.AmiCopy` instead.
 *
 * If you just want to share an existing AMI with another AWS account,
 * it's better to use `aws.ec2.AmiLaunchPermission` instead.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * // Create an AMI that will start a machine whose root device is backed by
 * // an EBS volume populated from a snapshot. It is assumed that such a snapshot
 * // already exists with the id "snap-xxxxxxxx".
 * const example = new aws.ec2.Ami("example", {
 *     ebsBlockDevices: [{
 *         deviceName: "/dev/xvda",
 *         snapshotId: "snap-xxxxxxxx",
 *         volumeSize: 8,
 *     }],
 *     rootDeviceName: "/dev/xvda",
 *     virtualizationType: "hvm",
 * });
 * ```
