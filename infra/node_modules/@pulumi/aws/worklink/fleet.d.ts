/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.worklink.Fleet("example", {});
 * ```
 *
 * Network Configuration Usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.worklink.Fleet("example", {
 *     network: {
 *         securityGroupIds: [aws_security_group_test.id],
 *         subnetIds: [aws_subnet_test.map(v => v.id)],
 *         vpcId: aws_vpc_test.id,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Identity Provider Configuration Usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 * import * as fs from "fs";
 *
 * const test = new aws.worklink.Fleet("test", {
 *     identityProvider: {
 *         samlMetadata: fs.readFileSync("saml-metadata.xml", "utf-8"),
 *         type: "SAML",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
