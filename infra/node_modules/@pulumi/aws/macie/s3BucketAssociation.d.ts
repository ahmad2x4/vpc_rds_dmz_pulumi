/**
 * Associates an S3 resource with Amazon Macie for monitoring and data classification.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Before using Amazon Macie for the first time it must be enabled manually. Instructions are [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/macie-setting-up.html#macie-setting-up-enable).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.macie.S3BucketAssociation("example", {
 *     bucketName: "tf-macie-example",
 *     classificationType: {
 *         oneTime: "FULL",
 *     },
 *     prefix: "data",
 * });
 * ```
