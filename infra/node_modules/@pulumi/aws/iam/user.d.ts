import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides an IAM user.
 *
 * > *NOTE:* If policies are attached to the user via the [`aws.iam.PolicyAttachment` resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_policy_attachment.html) and you are modifying the user `name` or `path`, the `forceDestroy` argument must be set to `true` and applied before attempting the operation otherwise you will encounter a `DeleteConflict` error. The [`aws.iam.UserPolicyAttachment` resource (recommended)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_user_policy_attachment.html) does not have this requirement.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const lbUser = new aws.iam.User("lb", {
 *     path: "/system/",
 *     tags: {
 *         "tag-key": "tag-value",
 *     },
 * });
 * const lbAccessKey = new aws.iam.AccessKey("lb", {
 *     user: lbUser.name,
 * });
 * const lbRo = new aws.iam.UserPolicy("lbRo", {
 *     policy: `{
 *   "Version": "2012-10-17",
 *   "Statement": [
 *     {
 *       "Action": [
 *         "ec2:Describe*"
 *       ],
 *       "Effect": "Allow",
 *       "Resource": "*"
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * `,
 *     user: lbUser.name,
 * });
 * ```
