/**
 * Manages a Route53 Hosted Zone.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Public Zone
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const primary = new aws.route53.Zone("primary", {});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Public Subdomain Zone
 *
 * For use in subdomains, note that you need to create a
 * `aws.route53.Record` of type `NS` as well as the subdomain
 * zone.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const main = new aws.route53.Zone("main", {});
 * const dev = new aws.route53.Zone("dev", {
 *     tags: {
 *         Environment: "dev",
 *     },
 * });
 * const devNs = new aws.route53.Record("dev-ns", {
 *     name: "dev.example.com",
 *     records: [
 *         dev.nameServers[0],
 *         dev.nameServers[1],
 *         dev.nameServers[2],
 *         dev.nameServers[3],
 *     ],
 *     ttl: 30,
 *     type: "NS",
 *     zoneId: main.zoneId,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Private Zone
 *
 * > **NOTE:** This provider provides both exclusive VPC associations defined in-line in this resource via `vpc` configuration blocks and a separate [Zone VPC Association](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/route53_zone_association.html) resource. At this time, you cannot use in-line VPC associations in conjunction with any `aws.route53.ZoneAssociation` resources with the same zone ID otherwise it will cause a perpetual difference in plan output. You can optionally use the generic this provider resource [lifecycle configuration block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#lifecycle) with `ignoreChanges` to manage additional associations via the `aws.route53.ZoneAssociation` resource.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Private zones require at least one VPC association at all times.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const privateZone = new aws.route53.Zone("private", {
 *     vpcs: [{
 *         vpcId: aws_vpc_example.id,
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
