 * Common code for doing RTTI typechecks.  RTTI is done by having a boolean property on an object
 * with a special name (like "__resource" or "__asset").  This function checks that the object
 * exists, has a **boolean** property with that name, and that that boolean property has the value
 * of 'true'.  Checking that property is 'boolean' helps ensure that this test works even on proxies
 * that synthesize properties dynamically (like Output).  Checking that the property has the 'true'
 * value isn't strictly necessary, but works to make sure that the impls are following a common
 * pattern.
